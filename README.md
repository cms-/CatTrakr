GPS-based tracking with long range 2.4GHz wireless ping

First project circa 2013-11

ATTiny85 sends command to GPS to begin logging to the GPS unit's internal memory when power is applied.

Later iterations transmitted coordinates (in ASCII characters) over nrf24 to a receiving station where the characters were printed to a graphic LCD.
